            <h3><strong>Purpose of the book</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>This early fourteenth-century manuscript antiphoner (antiphon book) is a volume of monophonic
            chant—plainsong, or plainchant—used by clerics for singing the Daily Office of the Roman Church. It contains
            the complete words and music for two genres of variable chants—antiphons and responsories—for the entire
            annual calendar of saints’ days (Sanctorale). The church or chapel that originally owned this book—probably
            belonging to the Franciscan order—would have needed another similar volume containing the corresponding
            annual Sunday cycle of the Daily Office (Temporale), as well as other volumes containing the chants of the
            Mass and other occasional services.</p>
        <p>By the late Middle Ages it had becomes customary for liturgical chant books arranged in calendar order to
            begin with the pre-Christmas season. The temporal (Sunday) cycle started with the First Sunday in Advent,
            and the sanctoral (saints-day) cycle with the major saint’s day usually closest to it, the feast of St.
            Andrew the Apostle (30 November). The services of the Daily Office covered by the contents of the book are
            shown in TABLE 1.</p>
        <p>The book does not include complete words and music of all the chants sung in the Daily Office. No special
            antiphons or responsories were required for the services of Prime (sung after Lauds) and Compline (after
            Vespers I and 2), so neither of these is mentioned in the book. Each of the antiphons that are included was
            sung before and after one of the 150 psalms or 2 main office canticles (Magnificat at Vespers, and
            Benedictus at Lauds), the full words and music for which are also not included here. The words are indicated
            only by verbal cues (incipits), all that was necessary since most clerics were expected to know the complete
            psalms and canticles by heart. The music was indicated, meanwhile, by a short melodic formula, or
            differentia. From the differentia, clerics would know immediately which of the 8 modes or tones each verse
            of the psalm or canticle would be sung to, and the particular form of variable ending to be used.</p>

            <h3><strong>Physical description and copying</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>Inside the leather covered boards that form its covers, the book now consists of 119 vellum parchment folios,
            roughly 300 mm in height. Of these, the first 114 are original, and were largely copied by a single scribe,
            with the exception of some late additions and corrections. As can be seen clearly in the margins, each page
            was ruled with dry-point guidelines. Ten 4-line staves were then drawn on each page in red ink, with square
            notes then added in black ink. The words or text of the chant were underlaid in black ink, the bottoms of
            the letters resting on guidelines. Later in the manuscript, there is also sometimes a second guideline
            indicating the tops of the letters. Necessary headings and directions (rubrics) were also added in red ink,
            with text incipits of chants referred to in black ink. Between the chants, small sections of the pre-drawn
            staves were later erased to allow space for the addition of occasional verbal headings and directions, and
            for the larger illuminated initials. In the first 12 folios, the larger initials are copied in either red or
            blue with fine penwork decorations. Thereafter blue in is used only very occasionally (e.g. for the initial
            of the opening antiphon of office of St. Clare, fol. 84r). The copyist also drew smaller initials, drawn in
            red and black inks with the same pen used for the text and music, almost always onto sections of un-erased
            stave. (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 3)
        <p>
        <p>After the first dozen folios, the large initials become much less elaborate, in red only and without any
            added penwork. Meanwhile, the copying becomes slightly less careful generally, and more prone to occasional
            oversights or mistakes. A number of such apparent “errors” are clustered together on a single page (fol.
            21r). During the original copying, the scribe omitted a whole antiphon <i>Tanto tempore vobiscum</i>.
            Realising this, he later copied the missing antiphon into the bottom margin, and added a small cross toward
            the end of the top staff, indicating where it was to be inserted. In the original copying, he also omitted
            the psalm differentia formulas from their usual places at the end of three other antiphons, <i>Si
                cognovissetis me</i>, <i>Ego sum vita veritas</i>, and <i>Si manseritis in me</i>, and so added these in
            the right margin later. Four omissions on the one page might suggest a concentration lapse on the part of
            our scribe. It is also possible, however, that he was copying faithfully from an earlier exemplar with the
            same omissions. (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 4)</p>
        <p>
            Like many chant manuscripts, this also one shows several instances of “palimpsest”, where the original
            copy—text and/or music—is erased and overwritten, either by the original copyist himself, or a later scribe.
            Such alterations are made for a variety of reasons. The original may contain a simple error; or the music or
            text of a chant as actually sung may alter over time, so that a later copyist may come along and rewrite the
            later version over the original. Perhaps this is what has occurred in the case of the alterations to the
            melody of the antiphon <i>Salve crux preciosa</i>. (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 5)</p>

            <h3><strong>Date and provenance of the manuscript</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>The precise place and date of origin of the manuscript are unknown, and neither the main copyist nor the
            binder has left clear indications. One of the most important of the few clues that remain is a single
            isolated rubric (red letter heading) which is not, as elsewhere in the manuscript and as would usually be
            expected, in Latin, but in German, reasonably suggesting that it was copied by a German scribe, and probably
            for use in Germany. (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 6)</p>
        <p>
            The inclusion of full offices for the feasts of St Francis and his sister St. Clare, and the absence of
            offices of certain other saints, further suggest that this book might have been copied for a church or
            chapel of the Franciscan order. And close comparison of the contents with books of known Franciscan
            provenance indeed support this case.</p>
        <p>Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order, died in 1226 and was canonised in 1228, his feast day set
            for 4 October each year. By 4 October 1235, the words and music of a new rhymed office for St. Francis had
            been written and composed by a Paris-based member of the order, Julian of Spyer. It is Julian’s office,
            usually titled Franciscus vir Catholicos (after its first antiphon), that is included in this manuscript.
            More recent still is the Office of St. Clare, Jam sanctae clarae claritas, a contrafactum of Julian’s
            Francis office, in which (as we shall see below) new rhymed texts were fitted to Julian’s earlier melodies.
            Clare was canonised in 1255, but this new office was not authorised for general use within the Franciscan
            order until 1292, and its inclusion here may help us set the likely date of copying of this manuscript to
            around the year 1400. Whereas Francis’s office was copied in calendar sequence among the rest of the proper
            of the saints, Clare’s office was added at the end, as if an afterthought, again suggesting that it was new
            or recent at the time the book was copied.</p>
        <p>There is one other unusual feature to manuscript, again to do with its inclusion of a very recently composed
            office. In 1264, pope Urban IV promulgated a new office for the feast of Corpus Christi, beginning with the
            Vespers antiphon Sacerdos in aeternum. Though the words were newly written, the melodies were borrowed and
            adapted from pre-existing chants. An early copy of the office from the papal court dating from Urban’s reign
            usefully indicates the sources of the chant melodies in the margin. Thomas Aquinas is traditionally
            attributed with authorship of the new words, though that now seems unlikely. Notably, none of the Franciscan
            antiphoners indexed in CANTUS originally included a Corpus Christi office, though in one case (Newbury) it
            was added later.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of Corpus Christi in our manuscript thus also supports a later dating for its copying. But what
            is most curious is its presence here in a book following the sanctorale (saints-day) cycle. Elsewhere the
            feast of Corpus Christi was almost always included in the dominical (Sunday) cycle.</p>

            <h3><strong>Franciscan's and the "Roman" chant</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>The company of little brothers (Fratricelli) founded by Giovanni Francesco di Bernardone, known as Francis of
            Assisi, obtained official support from pope Innocent III in 1210. According to the rule of 1223, clerical
            members of the order were to celebrate the divine office “according to the custom of the Roman Curia”
            (secundum consuetudinem Romanae curiae); this responsibility did not extend to lay brothers, who were given
            a simpler devotional regime. Though Franciscans were to follow the Roman curial (papal) liturgy, there is
            scant evidence of the precise form the Roman papal office took prior to this time. In fact, the “breviary of
            St Francis”—so named because it is supposed to have been used by the founder himself to say the Office—is,
            by default, the earliest surviving source believed to represent the papal office.[insert footnote 1] It is
            believed to reflect revisions carried out by Innocent III, dating from 1213-16, and by his successor
            Honorius III.</p>
        <p>Francis died in 1226 and was canonised in 1228 by pope Gregory IX. Thereafter the order’s original focus on
            untrained lay membership and missionary work to the poor gradually shifted under a largely clerical and
            university trained leadership. One of the earliest noted Franciscan scholars was the English-born Haymo of
            Faversham, who joined the order in 1224 and was minister general from 1240 until his death in 1244. Once the
            Franciscans had adopted the Roman office, the breviary was further revised by Haymo during his tenure as
            general at the specific request of Innocent IV. Thus, effectively, the pope gave Franciscans the
            responsibility of further revising the Roman papal liturgy.</p>
        <p>
            Whether the Franciscans also carried out a revision of the melodies of the curial office chants is unclear,
            again because of the lack of prior curial sources. However, scholarship tends to support a close musical
            identity between them. As eminent chant scholar David Hiley concludes: “We can therefore tell what chant was
            sung in the papal liturgy by inspecting notated Franciscan books (since papal ones do not survive).” Pope
            Nicholas III (1277-80), for instance, is reported to have decreed that no other books but Franciscan ones
            should be used in all Roman churches.[insert footnote 2] Moreover, as copyists and disseminators of the
            chant, the Franciscans proved to be extremely reliable. As Andrew W. Mitchell has observed in his study of
            the Franciscan office chants, “The Franciscan manuscripts are charcterized by a high degree of
            uniformity.”[insert footnote 3]</p>
