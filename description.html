<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Copying and decoration</span></p>

<p>Main manuscript, parts 1 and 2, dry point guidelines, 10 staves per page (black-ink square notation on 4-line red-ink staves, ruled separately with single nib, not rastrum) with text underlay (black ink, gothic minuscule liturgical book hand, <span style="font-style:italic">textualis</span>); rubricated; simple large initials in red ink (on fols. 1-12 only, elaborate in red and blue inks, with pen work hairline detailing); small initials in black ink, with red ink highlighting.</p>

<p>One main text scribe executed the main contents of part 1A and part 2 of the main manuscript, each part copied in order, with two different music scribes entering the notation. Another pair of text and music scribes was responsible for part 1B. The office of Corpus Christi was copied in two other different text hands and two other music hands, and appears to have been inserted as a unit, between parts 1A and 1B. There are a few only slightly later erasures, corrections, additions, and alterations to text and music; but no major text or music revisions; and no liturgical alterations to suggest that the book remained in use later than the mid-16th century. Another pair of hands copied text and music of the sequences added later at the ends of parts 1 and 2 of the manuscript, on pages left empty after the completion of copying of their main contents; at end of part 1, 10 staves per page; at end of part 2, 10 staves and 9 staves per page.</p>

<p>Added Venite manuscript (fols. 115-119), 9 staves per page, 12 staves on final <span style="font-style:italic">verso</span>, copied much later; black-ink square notation on pre-ruled 4-line red-ink staves; text underlay, black ink, gothic minuscule liturgical book hand; no rubrics; large and small initials in red ink.</p>

<p>For a closer examination of the text and music hands in each part of the book, see <a class="link_ref" href="/contents"><span style="font-weight:bold">Summary of contents, structure, and copying</span></a>.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">Dating and provenance</span></p>

<p>The style and format of the square-note musical notation of the main manuscript, and the gothic minuscule text hands, are consistent with a date of copying in the fourteenth century (1300s). There are no unequivocal internal indications of the date, geographical, or liturgical provenance of the volume, or its constituent parts. A single rubric in German or Flemish/Dutch (“der ander nocturnus”) (fol. 7<span style="font-style:italic">r</span>) suggests German provenance (probably south German, Austrian, or Swiss).</p>

<p>The inclusion of proper offices for Francis (words and music largely by Julian of Speyer, c. 1232) and Clare, together with a sequence for Francis, probably indicate that the book was copied for use by members of a Franciscan order, despite the absence other internal evidence of provenance within the order. Though it is perhaps more likely that the volume was created by and for (male) members of the Order of Friars Minor, there is nothing to preclude absolutely the possibility that it was created and owned by (women) Clarissans. The presence of the Clare office (a contrafactum of Julian’s Francis office, c. late 1200s) supports a date for copying of the proper to at the very earliest c.1300, but probably closer to the middle of the century.</p>

<p>A distinctive musical feature of the manuscript is a polyphonic second voice added to the first stanza only of the sequence <span style="font-style:italic">Caeli solem imitantes</span> (fol. 89<span style="font-style:italic">v</span>) in very simple organum. Also distinctive liturgically and musically are the rarely encountered Magnificat antiphon at first vespers of Clare, <span style="font-style:italic">O decus et gaudium</span> (fol. 85<span style="font-style:italic">r</span>), a contrafactum of the Francis antiphon <span style="font-style:italic">O stupor et gaudium</span> (fol. 59<span style="font-style:italic">v</span>), and, in the sequence for Francis, <span style="font-style:italic">Caeli cives in colono</span>, music and words of a previously unreported extra double verse, <span style="font-style:italic">Jam depulsa carnis mole </span>(fol. 114<span style="font-style:italic">v</span>). An unusual feature, liturgically and codicologically, is the apparent insertion of the recent office of Corpus Christi, <span style="font-style:italic">Sacerdos in aeternum</span> into the proper of the saints calendar (rather than into the temporale as later became usual).</p>

<p>The added manuscript, with nine tones for the Venite at matins, and text entered for a tenth whose music was never copied, is perhaps slightly earlier than the main manuscript. Though it is probably also of curial-Franciscan provenance, there is nothing to indicate that its production was related to the main manuscript. Folio fragments of a manuscript copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">Opus libellorum super jure pontificio</span> by Roffredo Benevento (copied perhaps before 1300), used as materials in binding the outer folios together, are clearly visible glued to the gutter edges of fols. 115<span style="font-style:italic">r</span> and 199<span style="font-style:italic">v</span>.</p>

<p>The curial-Franciscan sanctorale cursus of this manuscript and textual and melodic details of individual chants may be usefully compared with those in other Franciscan manuscripts indexed in the <a href="http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank">CANTUS database</a></p>

<p>The selection of the 9 tones for the Venite in the added manuscript may be usefully compared with that of later printed editions of the curial office, notably <span style="font-style:italic"><a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=j2pFAAAAcAAJ" target="_blank">Antiphonarium Romanum</a></span> (Venice: Giunta, 1596): fols. 2<span style="font-style:italic">r</span>-11<span style="font-style:italic">v</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Later preservation and ownership history</span></p>
<p>There is no indication of major alterations or addition reflecting later liturgical usages or revisions, and it therefore seems unlikely that the book was still in use after the promulgation of Pius V’s <span style="font-style:italic">Breviarium Romanum</span> in 1568. This may perhaps suggest that the church or chapel to which the book belonged came under Protestant control during the Reformation. A very large painted ink letter F, on the inside front cover, is of late design, and may have been a shelf mark of some sort. The firm of J. and J. Lubrano, music antiquarians, acquired the book from a private collection and sold it to Boston College in 1998 (not 1996 as the shelf mark might seem to suggest). In response to a request in 2016, the vendors were unable to provide information on previous owners, any data they once had having been lost in a failed computer data migration. <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold">Keywords</span></p>
