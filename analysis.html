            <h3><strong>The origins of the music</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>The offices of Francis and Clare are recent compositions (13th century) that help date the copying of the
            book of not much earlier and possibly a little later than the year 1300 (early 14th century). With a few
            other recent exceptions, however, the origins of most of the rest of the books contents can be traced back
            to much earlier stages of the so-called Gregorian chant tradition.</p>
        <p>Having become established in the church in Rome by the early part of the 8th century, in the latter part of
            the century this chant repertory was exported—text and music—by Roman cantors to northern Europe, where the
            emperor Charlemagne promulgated it for use throughout his Frankish dominions. Chant melodies had then still
            to be memorised and transmitted orally, but by the mid tenth century they began to be copied into musical
            notation. One of the earliest surviving notated office antiphoners was copied by the monk Hartker (d.1011),
            late in the tenth century (probably c.997), for the abbey of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Though Hartker’s
            neumes are described as “unheightened” or adiastematic (that is, they are only partial prompts, and do not
            alone give all the necessary pitch information to allow the reader to sing the melody), the majority of the
            chants in his book can still now be read by comparing them with later fully-notated sources, such as our
            early fourteenth–century Franciscan book.</p>
        <p>Fortuitously, quite a number of the chants in the latter book already appear with essentially the same
            melodies in Hartker’s late tenth-century book. In particular, the chants for the office of St. Andrew, and
            for the Common of Saints, may be compared. For instance, the following illustration compares the very first
            antiphon in our book, Unus ex duobus [b], for St. Andrew, with the much earlier notated version from
            Hartker’s antiphoner [a], and the modern printed version of the Liber usualis (1961) [c], all three examples
            closely similar versions of the same chant. The degree of similarity can be more easily appreciated by
            comparing the two square-note sources [b] and [c], which can be seen to be closely similar, if not quite
            identical. Such small differences, however, are common between chant sources. (pop-out image for
            ILLUSTRATION 7)</p>
        <p>
            Another distinctive recent feature of this otherwise completely monophonic manuscript is the inclusion of a
            brief passage of written polyphony. (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 8)</p>

            <h3><strong>An ancient office and a newly-composed office compared</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>Probably the majority of chants in this book are of considerable antiquity, though not all the chants of
            particular office will necessarily have their origins in the same time or place. In many cases, thematic
            suitability of a chant text is the only immediately obvious factor to explain its inclusion within a given
            office. As to the melodies, it is considerably harder to perceive meaningful reasons for why a particular
            chant was included. In more recent offices, as we shall shortly see, chants were often organised numerically
            according to mode. But in the relatively ancient office like that St. Andrew there is no such observable
            pattern. Chants seem to appear, on casual inspection, in a completely haphazard modal order. (see TABLE
            2)</p>
        <p>However, even here a pattern does seem occasionally to emerge. A case in point can be seen in the antiphons
            for Lauds in the above office of St Andrew, all six of which belong to the two Tetrardus modes, 7 and 8,
            sharing a common ending on G (fol. 3v-4r). Similar cases can be seen in the first five Lauds antiphons for
            St Lucy (fol. 5v), and the first five Vespers antiphons in the Common of Apostles (fol. 94v): [table]</p>
        <p>And an example in a different tonality, that of the Protus, mode 2, can be seen in four of the first five
            Vespers antiphons for the office for the Dead (80v-81r): [table]
        </p>
        <p>Different types of pre-planned groupings may be observed in the Office of the Purification, where the 9
            antiphons of Matins are grouped by mode neatly in threes.</p>
        <p>And in the Common of Apostles, where Matins antiphons 4-6 are all in mode 8: [table]</p>
        <p>How, why and when such examples of modal organisation came about, however, is unclear. But the three
            thirteenth-century offices in our book show unambiguous signs of intentional modal pre-planning. In the
            office of Corpus Christi, for instance, [table]</p>
        <p>In this case, however, the melodies were not newly composed in modal order, but were adapted from
            pre-existing chants. We know this because one of the important early musical manuscripts of the Corpus
            Christi office (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Lat. 1143) actually names the original chant from
            which the each melody was borrowed, and upon which the next chant is modelled.[insert footnote 4]</p>
        <p>
            For instance, the manuscript tells us that the first antiphon of Vespers, Sacerdos in aeternum, was made
            “Contra gloria tibi trinitas de Trinitate”; that is, it was modelled on the antiphon Gloria tibi trinitas
            for the feast of the Holy Trinity, as can indeed be seen in the illustration below. Likewise, the later
            much-loved melodies of the antiphons for the Magnificat at first and second vespers were also borrowed, O
            quam suavis es “Contra o Christe pietas de sco Nicholao” (the antiphon O Christe pietas for St. Nicholas),
            and O sacrum convivium “Contra Benedctus Dominus Deus patris nostri de sco Bernardo” (the antiphon Dominus
            Deus patris nostri from the Cistercian office of St. Bernard). (pop-out image for ILLUSTRATION 9)</p>

            <h3><strong>The 13th-century rhymed office of Francis by Julian of Spyer</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>Like almost all of the oldest chant texts, the words of the new antiphons and responsories for Corpus Christi
            are in prose. Julian of Spyer, however, wrote his new office of St. Francis, Francis vir catholicos, in
            metrical rhyming verse. Scholars refer to such offices as “rhymed offices” or “rhythmical offices”. Julian
            used a number of different metrical and rhyme schemes in his composition, as can be seen below. The first
            five antiphons for Vespers, for instance, are written in 6-line stanzas (rhyming AABAAB). The first three
            antiphons at Matins are in 4-line stanzas (rhyming ABAB). The first three responsories are considerably more
            complex in design, consisting of a 6-line main section (ABABAB), a 3-line verse (AAB), followed by a repeat
            of the last 2 lines of the main section (AB).</p>
        <p>And as was the case with the Corpus Christi office, Julian also arranged his newly composed chants in strict
            numerical patterns: [table]</p>
        <p>Incorporated within Julian of Speyer’s Francis office are items contributed by at least two other named
            authors. As noted in the rubrics, the Vespers hymn Proles de caelo prodiit (59v, text and music incipit
            only), was usually attributed to “our Lord Gregory the pope” (Gregory IX), the pope who canonized Francis in
            1328, as also in other sources is the 8th Matins responsory, De paupertatis horreo (63r). Meanwhile “lord
            cardinal Thomas” (Tommaso da Capua, cardinal of S. Sabina, d.1243) is credited with writing two items for
            Matins, the hymn, In caelesti collegio (60r, text incipit only), and the 7th responsory, Carnis spicam
            contentus are (62v). Several other items in the manuscript are extraneous to Julian’s original rhymed and
            modal plan: three additional responsories at Matins, nos 10-12 (63v-64v) and the extra antiphons, nos 1-4
            (66r-66v).</p>

            <h3><strong>The Clare contrafactum</strong></h3>
        </header>
        <p>We do not know who wrote the words of the office of St. Clare. But we do know that almost all of the music
            for it was borrowed from Julian of Spyer’s office of St. Francis. This was a particularly apt symbolically,
            because just as St. Clare was St. Francis’s sister, so their offices are closely related. As can be seen
            below, the new words for St. Clare were written especially to fit the same metrical rhyme schemes as
            Julian’s texts for St. Francis.</p>
        <p>Because of this, the next Clare texts can simply be matched, syllable by syllable, with the melodies for
            Julian’s Francis office. Therefore, as can be seen below, Julian’s strict modal order is replicated, along
            with his melodies, in all but the last two antiphons of the Clare office. [table]</p>
        <p>Two examples will suffice to show precisely how Julian’s melodies were fitted to the new Clare texts.</p>
